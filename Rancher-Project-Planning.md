# Releases
---
Rancher supports 2 versions for `rancher/server`. 

* `rancher/server:latest`: This version will be our development builds which will have been validated through our CI automation framework, but these releases are not meant for deployment in production. All development builds will be appended with a `*-pre{n}` suffix to denote that it’s a development release. These releases will be shipped bi-weekly to allow everyone to experiment with our latest features prior to release it into a stable build. 

* `rancher/server-enterprise`: This version will be our feature release builds, which Rancher recommends for deployment in production.
